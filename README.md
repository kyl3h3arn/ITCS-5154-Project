## Project Topic
- Bring machine learning (ML) to an area of interest <br/>
- **My Choice:** Cancer Research <br/>
- Motivation: Personal Connection, intriguing research, potential to future work. <br/>
## Project Goal
- Duplicate how others solve the problem or practice what you have learned in this course to solve the problem. <br/>
- **My Goal:** Test different ML algorithms to see which is best at predicting and/or diagnosing breast cancer. <br/>
## About
### This project aims to recreate research paper code that tests five machine learning algorithms on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset: <br/>
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Decision tree (C4.5)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) <br/>
- Two additional models will be added to see if there were any improvements (TBD)
